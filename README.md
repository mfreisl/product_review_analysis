## Value Proposition

Get actionable insights into the words, phrases and topics that are powering customer sentiment without having to read reviews manually. 

Our solution helps you understand the content of reviews in just a few minutes, without any need for manual categorization.

## MVP

NLP(Natural Language Processing)-based solution that will analyse product reviews from Yelp and Trustpilot. 

NLP can help us detect patterns and actionable insights from a large volume of review data.
## Relevance

- Boost sales
- Get ideas for improvement
- Increase customer satisfaction
- SE Ranking
## The process of the tool is the following 

1. Enter Company ID on our platform
2. Yelp and/or Trustpilot reviews scraped
3. Data is analysed using NLP
4. A dashboard with the key insights is displayed

## FAQ

#### What were the biggest challenges you encountered?

We encountered numerous challenges:
- before we had the models deployed on the cloud and were running it locally, our IP got banned by yelp
- our Huggingface model was taking way longer to load than expected, making it hard to work with
- and in general it was very challenging finishing with such limited time

#### What would you have implemented  if you had more time? (stretch goals)

- we would have really liked to implement a time-feature, which would have offered the customer the option to select a time period to retrieve reviews from; interesting for potentially identifying patterns or how the sentiment and the reviews changed over time
- also, Login for customers, where they could save their results and data
- and we would have also liked to be able to source from more websites
